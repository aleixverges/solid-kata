# Principles (LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle)

- Child classes should never break the parent class' type definitions. 
- Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

# Requirements change

Introduce Cars and Electric Buses as supported types
